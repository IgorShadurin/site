# OMG Network

OMG Network recently launched its Beta Mainnet Network. OMG is an Ethereum childchain, meaning it inherits the underlying security of Ethereum while allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. It uses a More Viable Plasma construction to achieve scaling.  OMG is designed to support payments and settlements securely, but lacks the flexibility and utility that the xDai sidechain provides. 

Below we highlight some of the key differences a user's perspective.

1. **Stable chain vs volatile chain**: xDai is a stable chain, meaning transactions as well as fees are paid with a stable token \(xDai, which inherits the Dai peg to the US dollar\). On xDai, buyers and sellers know that transactions retain their value, and developers can plan for costs related to micro-transactions. On OMG, users will be able to send stable currencies but fees are paid with OMG tokens, and tx costs are low but unpredictable. 
2. **500X cost optimization vs 3X cost optimization:** Both chains offer reduced costs for transactions. However, xDai achieves much higher costs savings. These savings add up quickly. An Ethereum transaction costing $10.00 may cost $3.33 on OMG. On xDai, it costs less than $.02.  **5X speed vs 100x speed:** xDai is considerably faster than Ethereum and provides a congestion solution while maintaining block size/gas limit compatibility. OMG currently has the ability to process many more transactions per second. However, this capability is theoretical and has not been reached for either chain. If xDai begins to experience congestion, horizontal scalability \(adding more chains\) and vertical scalability \(increasing gas limits, block times and node operator hardware\) can be engaged to meet demand. ****
3. **Smart Contract Support / ERC721 Support vs ETH/ERC20 support:**  This may be one of the biggest differentiators between the chains. xDai is fully compatible with smart contracts on Ethereum, and they can be ported over with little effort. ERC721s can be bridged to xDai, as can ERC677 and other token types.  This expands the reach for xDai and the programs it can support. Crypto art, NFTs, community currencies, games, defi protocols and more can all migrate and flourish on xDai right now.  OMG is a secure choice for for token payments and settlements, but it is not designed to handle many other types of Ethereum applications. 
4. **2 minute exit vs 2 week exit**: Moving assets to either chain is easy. Moving them back to Ethereum is easy on xDai, and more difficult with OMG. Due to exit game challenge periods, OMG assets cannot be easily transferred back to Ethereum. With the TokenBridge interoperability solution, tokens can be moved from xDai to Ethereum in minutes. 
5. **Production vs Beta**:  xDai is a proven, in-production solution for nearly 2 years at the time of this writeup. OMG - less than 3 months. Developers and users are actively using xDai every day, the network has been stress-tested and proven to handle large-scale events. Currently there are over 20,000 txs processed per day on xDai. OMG has been in development for a long time, and is now currently in Beta.  New solutions need some time to be "battle tested", and OMG CTO Kasima says it best when talking about other L2 scaling solutions like Roll-ups.  "Newer research like Roll-Ups is an interesting research area, but it's still experimental and will undergo a significant learning/development curve. As someone who’s running a business, I would be wary of anyone willing to put absolute faith in a research-grade solution or tool. There are a lot of unknowns, and it’s risky for customers."
