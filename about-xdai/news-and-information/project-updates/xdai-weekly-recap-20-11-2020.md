## üí∞ Ecosystem Funding

### ‚úÖ Buidl Guidl 

Austin Griffith's latest project aims to connect funders and developers through a quadratic funding mechanism. This provides signals about what funders want in rapid rounds, and devs can then rapidly iterate on experimental projects designed to support the entire Ethereum Ecosystem. Funding is on Ethereum, at [https://support.buidlguidl.com/](https://support.buidlguidl.com/) and bounties are on xDai. Many xDai-centric projects are available to fund.

### ‚úÖ clr.fund

[clr.fund](http://clr.fund/#/) provides permissionless quadratic funding to Ethereum projects. After a successful first run, clr.fund Round 1 introduces [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) for Sybil resistance and mid-round sign ups for contributors.  This round ~$1,000 of matching funds were provided by STAKEhaus \(a moloch DAO on xDai sponsored by RaidGuild and xDAI\).
