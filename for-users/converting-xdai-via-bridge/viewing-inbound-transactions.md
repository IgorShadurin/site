# Viewing Inbound Transactions

When Dai is transferred from Ethereum to xDai on the xDai chain, the amount of Dai in your wallet will decrease and the corresponding amount of xDai will increase. However, the transaction will not appear on the xDai side of the wallet.  The easiest way to track it is in BlockScout with the Coin Balance History view.

1\) Copy the Address used for the transaction

![Copy Address - you can be connected to Ethereum or xDai, it is the same address on both chains.](../../.gitbook/assets/tut22.jpg)

2\) Paste the address into BlockScout at [https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/)

4\) Scroll down to see incoming and outgoing amounts.  Your transaction should appear here.

Red are outgoing txs and green are incoming. You can click on the Block Number from here to find your transaction in the block if you'd like more information.

6\) Here you see the recipient address, the value, and the tx hash from Ethereum Mainnet of the transaction.

7\) This tx hash can be copy/pasted into Etherscan, connecting the initiating transaction on Ethereum to the resulting tx on xDai.
