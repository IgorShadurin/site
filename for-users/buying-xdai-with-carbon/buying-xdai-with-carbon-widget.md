# Buying xDai with Carbon Widget

{% hint style="danger" %}
xDai direct purchases \(Carbon or Wyre\) are currently under construction.  Purchase Dai on the mainnet and use the [Bridge UI to get xDai](../converting-xdai-via-bridge/), or for an all-in-one exchange process you can use the[ Burner Wallet Exchange](../burner-wallet-functions/exchange-currencies.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Carbon's access is currently limited by certain geolocations based on IP address, including the US \(coming soon\). Here is a full list of restricted countries: [https://docs.carbon.money/docs/blocked-countries](https://docs.carbon.money/docs/blocked-countries).

Carbon is available now using an IP from a non-blocked country.
{% endhint %}

1\) Open the "Carbon" widget in your favorite browser [https://buy.carbon.money](https://buy.carbon.money/). 

2\) Select **xDai** from the **Select Cryptocurrency** drop-down. Type desired amount of xDai in the **Amount** input field.

#### Carbon Limits/ KYC \(Know-Your-Customer\) Policy:

* Minimum purchase amount: **$5 US**
* Maximum daily purchase **without KYC** \(no identity verification required\) : **$250 USD**
* Maximum daily purchase **with KYC** \(identity verification required\): **$2500 USD**

![Up to $250 can be purchased per day without identity verification](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-10-14-at-6.03.13-pm.png)

3\) In the **You pay** and **You receive** fields you will see the amount your card will be charged, Carbon's fees, and amount you will receive. Type **Next** and enter your xDai wallet address. 

{% hint style="info" %}
xDai uses the same key derivation as Ethereum main network, which means **you can use the same addresses you use for your Ethereum account**. However, be sure that your wallet supports switching to the xDai network \(see supported wallets list or MetaMask instructions\).
{% endhint %}

4\) Enter your **e-mail address** and **phone number** in the corresponding fields. The service will ask you to type in a verification code. If you have [Authy](https://authy.com/) 2fa application installed for you number, you will receive the code in the app. If not, you will receive a text message with the code.

5\) Select **Credit/Debit Card** in "How would you like to pay?"  and press **Next**.

{% hint style="info" %}

Also, it will generate one-time use cards that can protect your main card from possible leaks. Here is the reference [link](https://privacy.com/join/ME94Y) . Using the link, you will get $5 to spend anywhere online \(and me too\)!
{% endhint %}
