# EIP-1559

## What is EIP-1559

EIP 1559 introduces a `Base Fee` for all blockchain transactions. This is a minimum fee charged for each transaction, and it is adjusted depending on network congestion \(gas usage per block\). When gas usage is high, the fee increases, and when it is low, the fee decreases. 

Once collected, base fees are burned by the protocol rather than paid directly to the miners \(or validators in the case of xDai\). In addition to the base fee, a `priority fee` can be added to a transaction to incentivize miners \(validators\) to include it in a block.

## How 1559 will impact xDai

When EIP-1559 is implemented, xDai base fees will be burned within the protocol. This will result in a discrepancy between the xDai balance on the network and the DAI balance from Ethereum locked in the xDai bridge. To fix this imbalance, the corresponding amount of DAI on the mainnet will need to be used as well.

The plan is to use the corresponding amount of DAI to purchase and burn STAKE on Ethereum, thus decreasing the STAKE total supply and providing a deflationary mechanism for the token. The mechanism processes are still in development.

Block size will also be increased - likely to 30M with this upgrade \(exact increase will be finalized based on test implementation results\). This will increase per-block capacity for transactions and balance the `base fee` implementation.

## How EIP-1559 will impact xDai validators 

STAKE rewards for validators will not be influenced by this transition, however transaction fee rewards \(in xDai\) will be impacted, as the base fee will be burned by the protocol. Validators will still receive xDai for any priority fees set by users. ‌

Currently, xDai validators receive all xDai transaction fees in addition to STAKE rewards. STAKE was designed as the primary incentive for validators \(see the [whitepaper for more info](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifaMGDFUZfAJyjXA-kTwuwhmTv1-xHwIajzEGjFt-7c/edit#)\), and these rewards will remain the same for validators and delegators. The objective of the STAKE buyback-and-burn mechanism is to reduce the supply of STAKE, leading to increased value for validators, delegators, and all xDai STAKE users.

## When EIP-1559

The xDai team is working closely with the Nethermind client team to support EIP-1559 on xDai. Plans are to integrate 1559 prior to the mainnet implementation, which is scheduled for [late July 2021](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y3yyTqeqRO1O2UFVkNkHK_V5oRulZd6y-JJbSnKYrb4/edit#gid=0). 

‌The upgrade will start with the Kovan testnet to explore and test various usage scenarios. We expect the Kovan implementation in June 2021 with xDai following shortly thereafter, based on client and network readiness. 

The xDai implementation will serve as an important gauge for its efficacy and usage patterns. xDai is a compatible EVM network with real value, providing an excellent launchpad for EIP1559 before it goes live on the Ethereum mainnet.
