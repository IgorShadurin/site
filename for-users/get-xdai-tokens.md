# Getting xDai tokens

xDai tokens are used to pay for gas and transactions on the xDai chain. They are a stable token \(worth ~ 1 USD\) created from locked Dai. 

Ways to acquire xDai stable tokens:

* From another user on the xDai Chain
* Converting Dai to xDai using the [xDai Bridge](converting-xdai-via-bridge/)
* Purchase directly with fiat using [Ramp.Network](https://ramp.network/buy/?swapAsset=XDAI)
* Trading on [Honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org/) \(you will need a small amount of xDai to start to execute a trade\)

{% hint style="info" %}
The xDai ecosystem is a [dual token environment](../for-stakers/stake-reward-mechanics/dual-token-model.md) with the xDai stable token and the STAKE governance token. [Learn more about STAKE and how to get STAKE](../for-stakers/stake-token/get-stake/).
