# Buying xDai with Portis via Carbon



{% hint style="danger" %}
xDai direct purchases \(Carbon or Wyre\) are currently under construction.  Purchase Dai on the mainnet and use the [Bridge UI to get xDai](../converting-xdai-via-bridge/), or for an all-in-one exchange process you can use the[ Burner Wallet Exchange](../burner-wallet-functions/exchange-currencies.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your billing address is located in the U.S., Wyre is used to purchase xDai via the Portis wallet. If outside the US, you will use [Carbon](../buying-xdai-with-wyre/buying-xdai-with-portis.md) to buy xDai in the Portis wallet.

With Carbon, up to $250 in xDai may be purchased per day without KYC verification. 
{% endhint %}



1\) Go to [portis.io](https://www.portis.io/) and click the **Get Started** button to create a new wallet \(or login to an existing wallet if you have one\).
