# Moving xDai to Dai

1\) Go to [https://dai-bridge.poa.network](https://dai-bridge.poa.network). [Connect your web3 wallet](../wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) \(MetaMask, Nifty Wallet\) to the **xDai Chain**. Once connected, you will see your address populated in the header, and your xDai and Dai balance displayed on the page.

* If you are experiencing issues or for personal preference, you can go to [https://xdai.io/](https://xdai.io/) and exchange using the burner application.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a small additional amount of xDai to process the transaction.
