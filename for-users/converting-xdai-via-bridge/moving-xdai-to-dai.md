# Moving xDai to Dai

1\) Go to [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/). [Connect your web3 wallet](../wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) \(MetaMask, Nifty Wallet\) to the **xDai Chain**. Once connected, you will see your address populated in the header, and your xDai and Dai balance displayed on the page. 

{% hint style="success" %}
If you are experiencing issues or for personal preference, you can go to [https://xdai.io/](https://xdai.io/) and exchange using the burner application.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a small additional amount of xDai to process the first transaction, and an additional amount of Eth to process the claim transaction on Ethereum.
{% endhint %}

_Note: If you change the dropdown on the page \(xDai Chain\) but not in MetaMask, the interface will shift but your wallet will not auto-connect to the chain. Switching chains in MM will automatically shift the interface._

2\) Enter the amount of xDai you would like to transfer to Dai, and click the **Transfer** button. Note the **minimum amount is 10 xDai.**

3\) A confirmation window will appear. Click **Continue.**

8\) Wait for confirmations from validators on Mainnet. Once this is complete, you should see the Success message.  xDai has been transferred to Dai and is available for use on the Ethereum mainnet.
