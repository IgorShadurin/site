**Latest News**

üö∞ The new OmniBridge auto-faucet sends $0.01 xDai when bridging tokens from Ethereum or BSC. This provides instant transaction capabilities for new users! [Learn More](for-users/get-xdai-tokens/xdai-faucet.md#omnibridge-faucet)

‚èπ Gas Limit/Block increased to 17M, resulting in 30%+ increase in TPS capacity.

üéâ Berlin HardFork successfully activated **May 17,** Block **16101500** on xDai. If running a node, please upgrade to [OpenEthereum](for-developers/install-xdai-client/parity.md) v3.2.5 or [Nethermind v1.10.71](for-developers/install-xdai-client/nethermind.md).

## xDai Stable Chain

The xDai chain is a stable payments blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The chain uses a unique dual-token model; [xDai ](for-users/get-xdai-tokens/)is a stable token used for transactions, payments, and fees, and [STAKE](for-stakers/stake-token/) is a governance token used to support the underlying [POSDAO Proof-of-Stake](for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md) consensus.

## **xDai Developers**

Development on xDai is easy and intuitive for Ethereum developers. xDai is an EVM sidechain, and smart contracts can be written and deployed in exactly the same way simply by setting a [different RPC endpoint.](for-developers/developer-resources/#json-rpc-endpoints) 

Any contract that works on the Ethereum mainnet can be redeployed to the xDai chain. On the xDai chain, transaction costs are minimized, and all fees and transactions are paid with a single token, xDai. **Many tools supporting Ethereum development** are compatible with xDai, including:

* [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/)
* [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)
* [Remix](https://remix-project.org/)
* [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/)
* [BlockNative](https://www.blocknative.com/)
* [Gnosis Safe MultiSig](https://gnosis-safe.io/)
* [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/home)
* Many more......
