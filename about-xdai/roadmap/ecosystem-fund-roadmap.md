# Ecosystem Fund Roadmap

xDai STAKE Ecosystem fund unlocks begin March 31, 2021. This is an important fund designed to support the further development, expansion, and adoption of xDai and STAKE. As such, funds will be used in a number of ways. 

Here we offer some initial use cases for the fund. We will continue to expand this page, adding additional uses and use-cases as they arise. If you have an idea for usage that aligns with xDai values \(long-term growth, neutral ecosystem expansion, security and support, and sustainable project development\) please feel free to [propose in our forum](https://forum.poa.network/c/xdai-chain/xdai-proposals/43).

{% hint style="success" %}
We are exploring additional measures to ensure fund transparency and funding alignment with community and development needs. Look for more updates soon re: fund allocation governance and reporting.
{% endhint %}

### Gnosis Partnership

* 250,000 STAKE
* Our partnership with Gnosis includes their investment in STAKE along with deployments of their product suite. More on this investment and collaboration is [available here](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-protocol-and-xdai-partnership-1de0e48fb14b).

### Immunefi Bug Bounties

* 400,000+ STAKE to support multiple bounties
* We plan to initiate additional high-value bounties for EasyStaking, POSDAO and other applications with available STAKE ecosystem funds. [More here](../../for-developers/immunefi-bug-bounty.md)

### xDai Grants Program

* 43,000 STAKE Wave 1
* The xDai Grants Program will begin to support projects requiring funds for development, adoption, use-case support or other features. A form for wave 1 applicants will be available when the program begins. [More info](../../for-developers/grants/)

### Increase STAKE liquidity on DEX platforms

* Amount TBD
* When providing liquidity to DEXs in the ecosystem it is necessary to provide 2 different assets. To prevent the sale of STAKE to acquire these assets, we will leverage protocols such as [Unit Protocol](https://unit.xyz/) and MakerDAO to lock in STAKE and acquire additional collateral to support liquidity. Any positions we open will be with a high collateral to debt ratio to prevent unexpected liquidation and unnecessary risk.
