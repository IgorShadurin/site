# Features

## xDai Native Stable Coin

A stable coin means peace of mind. Predictable currencies allow buyers and sellers to exchange value without the risks of volatility. In the xDai Stable Chain implementation, transactions are conducted using xDai, a stable coin with 1:1 value ratio to Dai. Because transactions occur on a bridged sidechain, they are extremely fast and inexpensive. In addition, transactions and fees are paid with a single coin.

## STAKE Multi-Chain Staking & GovernanceToken

The STAKE token on xDai is used by validators and delegators to secure the xDai chain. Users may participate in chain consensus, either as validators running xDai nodes, or delegators placing stake on those nodes. Participants place STAKE to secure the chain, and receive rewards in both STAKE and xDai \(for validators\) thanks to[ unique reward mechanics](../for-stakers/stake-token/stake-reward-mechanics/).

STAKE also serves in a governance capacity. Community members can [create and vote on proposals](../for-stakers/stake-token/stake-weighted-voting/) to change or update the protocol. These changes are then taken into consideration by the xDai validators and team.

Additional sidechains will also have the opportunity to use STAKE to secure their chains, making this the first multi-chain enabled staking token.

## Neutral Network

The xDai chain provides a vital public utility for users - the ability to transfer stable value free of speculative concerns, volatility, or FUD \(fear, uncertainty & doubt\). xDai is an independent network, built to support transactions that hold value. When DAI is bridged to xDai, it moves to a platform with a clear, transparent purpose; secure & stable transactions on a fast, neutral network.

Open governance, open access, and token stability create a trusted environment for users as well as applications built on top of xDai.

## Scalability 

xDai supports low cost, stable transactions for projects and users. high Ethereum gas prices and congestion have made it difficult for the ecosystem to function efficiently. xDai provides a compatible chain for projects requiring nano-transactions or complex transactions that may be prohibitively expensive on Ethereum. xDai can scale both vertically \(infrastructure and chain parameter optimization\) and horizontally \(additional chain deployments\) to meet capacity requirements. 

## On-Chain Randomness

Using a RANDAO-based Random Number Generator, validators on xDai produce random numbers used for validator selection. These random seeds are also available for usage by contracts deployed to xDai. This allows for true on-chain randomness, eliminating the need to rely on a centralized service or 3rd party application. More information on how the xDai RNG works is [available here](../for-developers/on-chain-random-numbers/).

## POSDAO Consensus

The xDai Stable Chain uses a delegated Proof of Stake \(DPOS\) consensus mechanism called POSDAO. The [POSDAO white paper](../for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md) describes all aspects of this new consensus protocol including a complete overview of the theory, rationale, security, and a detailed implementation section.

## Bridges to Ethereum

Two bridges connect the xDai Stable Chain to the Ethereum mainnet, supporting seamless two-way asset transfer between chains. Tokens are acquired on the mainnet, then bridged to the xDai Stable Chain sidechain using either the Dai-xDai bridge for transactional tokens, or the OmniBridge for any cross-chain transfers. Once a user is finished transacting or staking, tokens can be bridged back to the mainnet with ease.

### Bridged Tokens

View tokens that have been bridged to xDai with the [OmniBridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/multi-token-extension) using the [OmniBridge UI ](https://xdai-omnibridge.web.app/)built by [RaidGuild](https://raidguild.org/)
