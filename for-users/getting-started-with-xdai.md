# Getting Started with xDai

## 1\) Set your Chain ID and RPC

To get started on xDai, you will need to setup your externally owned address \(wallet address\) to access the xDai chain. You can use the same address you use on Ethereum, but the chain id and RPC must point to xDai.  

* See the [MetaMask Setup tutorial](wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) for example steps and configuration.
* If desired, you can also use a [different RPC endpoint](../for-developers/developer-resources/#json-rpc-endpoints).
* See the [wallets section](wallets/) for additional wallets that support xDai out of the box and don't require configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Default chain settings:** Network Name: xDai,  New RPC URL: [https://rpc.xdaichain.com/](https://rpc.xdaichain.com/), Chain ID: 0x64, Symbol: xDai, Block Explorer URL: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/)
{% endhint %}

## 2\) Get a Little xDai  

You can use the [xDai Faucet](get-xdai-tokens/xdai-faucet.md) to request 0.01 xDai, enough for hundreds of simple transactions. 

Alternately, you can convert Dai on Ethereum to xDai with the [xDai bridge,](bridges/converting-xdai-via-bridge/) or [purchase xDai directly from BitMax](https://bitmax.io/en/basic/cashtrade-spottrading/usdt/xdai) or with Fiat using the [Ramp Network](get-xdai-tokens/buying-xdai-with-fiat/ramp-network.md).

## 3\) BlockScout is your Home Base

BlockScout is the xDai gateway for exploring activities on the chain and accessing token and contract information. In the Apps menu you can find links to bridges, transaction monitoring tools, staking and more. You can explore the various bridged tokens, view daily transactions, active accounts and other on-chain happenings.
