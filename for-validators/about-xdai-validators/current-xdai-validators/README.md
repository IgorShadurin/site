# Current xDai Validator Organizations

⚔ xDai chain consensus is currently provided by a dedicated group of organizations who donate their time and resources to protect the chain. Their main incentive is not financial rewards \(they make less than they spend on infrastructure\) but a desire to invent new solutions, participate in on-chain governance, and support complimentary ecosystem tools.

Thanks to these groups, the xDai chain has proven to be resilient and robust since its inception. xDai has provided speed and low-cost, stable transactions for a variety of blockchain projects. This includes transactional capacity for varying [conferences of up to 10,000 participants](https://www.xdaichain.com/about-xdai/use-cases/cryptocurrency-for-events-and-conferences/pony-purse-conference-and-event-wallet), [community currencies in Africa](https://www.xdaichain.com/about-xdai/use-cases/community-currencies), and [pop-up crypto events](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/decentralized-cypherpunk-speakeasy-2fdbdc446318) throughout the world.  

The organizations who believe in this project and have helped it grow are listed below. When xDai transitions to POSDAO consensus these organizations will also serve as the initial PoS validators. They will shepherd in the new Proof of Stake functionality while a permissionless, decentralized chain is forged from the ground up. 

The community is thankful and appreciative of these organizations who have helped create, nurture and grow the one and only xDai stable chain.
