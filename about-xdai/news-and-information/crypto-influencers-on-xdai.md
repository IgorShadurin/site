# Crypto Influencers on xDai

The xDai Chain has been one of crypto's breakout success stories. Its prominent use at mainstream Eth events and support from the crypto community have made some of the biggest names in Ethereum stand up, listen, and experience the magic of xDai for themselves.

 Below are some mentions xDai has received from influencers in the community:



## Dr Gavin Wood

> We will introduce a **Substrate to** [**Parity-Ethereum-PoA**](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum) **bridge**, very similar to our existing [Parity Bridge](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bridge) that sits at the heart of the [xDAI](https://xdai.io/) chain...

## Anthony Pompliano

> xDAI is a `MAGICAL` first experience for people. Ric showed it to me and I've used it multiple times with those unfamiliar with crypto. It leads to them wanting to learn more very quickly.

## Vitalik Buterin

> Burner Wallet \([website](https://xdai.io/), [explainer article](https://settle.finance/blog/what-is-the-burner-wallet-and-whats-xdai/)\) is an "insta-wallet" that's very easy to use: just load it up on your desktop or phone, and there you have it. It was used successfully at EthDenver to sell food from food trucks, and generally many people appreciate its convenience. Its main weaknesses are lower security and that one of its features, support for xDAI, is dependent on a permissioned chain.

Note: After xDai moved to POSDAO, the permissioned critique is less  valid
