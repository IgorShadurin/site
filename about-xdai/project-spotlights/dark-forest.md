# Dark Forest

[Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) is an MMO space-conquest game where players discover and conquer planets in an infinite, procedurally-generated, cryptographically-specified universe! Featuring:

* **Super-easy onboarding**: A customized burner wallet airdropped with a few cents in xDai lets users start immediately, no MetaMask or other wallet needed.
* **Auto-transactions**: Burner wallet can be configured for auto-transactions, speeding gameplay.
* **zksnarks**: The first multi-level incomplete information game created on blockchain. ZK protocols allow users to make verifiable moves with exact details still hidden from other players.
* **Fast block confirmations**: xDai provides inexpensive txs and importantly fast block confirmations, so gameplay is fast and smooth

## About Dark Forest

Using [zkSNARKS](https://blog.zkga.me/intro-to-zksnarks), dark forest is able to create an incomplete information game, so that user locations can be obscured while still submitting verifiable transactions.

Dark Forest was inspired by Liu Cixinâ€™s _Three Body Trilogy_ \(ä¸‰ä½“\), particularly the second novel _Dark Forest_ and a thought experiment by the same name.

The latest version \(v0.4\) uses a burner wallet and is in production on xDai. This allows for a higher TPS as well as real economic value loaded onto the game. In addition, users are airdropped a small amount of xDai so they can begin gameplay immediately, without any external wallet or need to get xDai to start. Once users are accustomed to gameplay they can add additional xDai if desired.

## Get Started

Simply go to [https://zkga.me/](https://zkga.me/) to start \(note that the game is in Beta and you will need a whitelist key to participate\). At the start, a few command line prompts will get things going, and you can create a new burner wallet or use another wallet \(one without too much value, as private keys will be stored in local storage\)
