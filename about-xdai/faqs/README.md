## How do I find the information I need?

There is a lot to know about xDai, so we've split the website into several sections, depending on your role and what you info you might need to access.

* **About xDai**: General features, overview, latest news and information designed for new users or those who want to learn more about xDai.
* **For Users**: If you want to transact with xDai, use xDai DApps or wallets.
* **For Stakers**: If you want to delegate STAKE on chain and earn rewards, or become a validator candidate. This section is related to xDai consensus and the STAKE token, which protects the chain.
* **For Developers**: If you want to build on xDai, all the resources you need are in this section.
* **For Validators**: This section is geared towards validators - setting up and running a node, bridge validator info, and other information. This section will change as the chain transforms to public validation.
* **Contact & Media**: To reach us, or gather assets for interviews.
