To begin, enable your web3wallet \(such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [NiftyWallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nifty-wallet/jbdaocneiiinmjbjlgalhcelgbejmnid)\) with an address that contains both ETH \(for gas fees\) and STAKE \(for staking\). If you've sent STAKE to your wallet address but it is not showing up, [add STAKE as a custom token](../stake-token/get-stake/add-stake-to-metamask.md). Then connect your wallet to the application.

## Make A Deposit / Multi-Deposits

Check estimated emissions with the UI calculator and make a deposit from the deposit screen.  Easy Staking has a multi-deposit feature where you can make as many deposits as you like and each one accrues interest based on the staking time.

There are two types of withdrawals - Instant and Scheduled. Select the type you would like and confirm in your web3 wallet.

1. A **scheduled withdrawal** is processed in 2 transactions. With the first transaction, you schedule the withdrawal. It will be available to withdraw after 12 hours, and for a limited 12 hour time frame once it is available. Scheduled withdrawals do not incur a % fee \(but gas fees are assessed for both transactions\). More details are available here
2. An **instant withdrawal** is processed immediately and you are assessed a small fee \(2%\) to withdraw.
