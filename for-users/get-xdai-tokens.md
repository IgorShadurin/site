# Getting xDai tokens

Main ways to acquire xDai tokens:

* From another user on the xDai Chain
* Converting Dai to xDai using the [xDai Bridge](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/converting-xdai-via-bridge) 

{% hint style="info" %}
xDai direct purchases \(Carbon or Wyre\) are currently under construction.  Purchase Dai on the mainnet and use the bridge to get xDai, or for an all-in-one exchange process you can use the[ Burner Wallet Exchange](burner-wallet-functions/exchange-currencies.md).
{% endhint %}

* using [Wyre](buying-xdai-with-wyre/)
