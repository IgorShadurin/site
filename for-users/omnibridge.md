# OmniBridge \(for all other ERC20 tokens\)

OmniBridge can be used to bridge any existing ERC20 on Ethereum Mainnet to xDai and back. The first time a token is bridged, a new ERC677 token contract is deployed on xDai and the token name is extended to include "on xDai". If a token has been bridged previously, the previously deployed contract is used. In both cases, the requested amount of tokens is minted and sent to the account that initiated the transfer.
