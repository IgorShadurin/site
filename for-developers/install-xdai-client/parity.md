# OpenEthereum \(formerly Parity\)

## Install OpenEthereum

You can  build from source or download a binary release, see the official [3.0 Releases Page](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum/releases) for download information for Linux, Mac & Windows.

### Binary Instructions

{% hint style="info" %}
These instructions are copied from the OpenEthereum wiki at [https://openethereum.github.io/wiki/Setup](https://openethereum.github.io/wiki/Setup)
{% endhint %}

* **Linux**
  * Download the latest release from the link above
  * Make the `parity` file executable by running `chmod u+x parity`
  * Launch Parity Ethereum: `./openethereum --chain xdai --no-warp`

{% hint style="info" %}
The `--no-warp` flag is recommended if you want all historical data, but will take much longer to sync. For a faster sync, you do not need to use it. [More information on --no-warp](https://openethereum.github.io/wiki/Getting-Synced)
{% endhint %}

* Mac
  * Download the mac binary.
  * Open a terminal and navigate to the directory using `cd /path/to/binary/folder/`.
  * Make the binary executable by running `chmod +x parity`.
  * You can now double click on the binary. 
* Windows Download the binary and double click on it.

### Dependencies <a id="dependencies"></a>

## Once OpenEthereum is Installed,  Connect and Sync with xDai

```text
openethereum --chain xdai --no-warp
```

#### Optional

`--no-warp` flag is optional: [more information.](https://openethereum.github.io/wiki/Getting-Synced)

_If you would like to limit or choose specific bootnodes, you can obtain the bootnodes.txt file from POA github:_

```bash
git clone -b dai https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec.git
```

enter all supplied enodes for the desired network separated by a comma, no space

```text
openethereum --chain xdai --bootnodes enode://ENODE@IP:PORT,enode://ENODE@IP:PORT
```

### Connect to your Node

You can use Ethereum's JSON-RPC or a JavaScript console:  
[https://openethereum.github.io/wiki/Basic-Usage](https://openethereum.github.io/wiki/Basic-Usage)

### Smart contract development

You can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) connected to a local OpenEthereum full node for smart contracts development and deployment. Make sure that Remix is allowed to connect to your node by setting up the right [JSON-RPC cors policy](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/54639/is-it-possible-to-connect-remix-and-parity?rq=1).
