# Roadmap

{% hint style="warning" %}
The xDai roadmap is a high-level strategic plan designed to guide xDai research and development. Target dates and details are reviewed regularly and subject to move, adjust and change as the project evolves. Note that only completed items \( âœ… Status: Complete\) are considered achieved project milestones.
{% endhint %}

_Last update: 06.08.2020 \|_ [_Changelog_](roadmap.md#change-log)\_\_

## Fiat to xDai Onramp

\*\*\*\*ðŸŽ¯ **Target:** Q4 2019  
 â˜‘ **Status:** In process. Carbon implementation complete, additional implementations ongoing.

{% hint style="success" %}
The [Carbon on-ramp](../for-users/buying-xdai-with-carbon/) for xDai is in development \(functionality is dependent on geo-location\).
{% endhint %}

At the moment, to get xDai, most users have to get Dai first and relay it to xDai via xDai Bridge. The process is complicated and time-consuming due to congestions on the Ethereum networks and the probabilistic nature of Proof of Work consensus. Relayers of the xDai bridge are waiting for eight blocks on Ethereum before they relay Dai to xDai.

The xDai team is working with payment processing companies to enable Fiat to xDai onramp. To facilitate the integration of xDai fiat onramp into wallets, the team started "xDai Adoption Fund" [https://www.xdaichain.com/for-developers/grants\#xdai-adoption-fund](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-developers/grants#xdai-adoption-fund)

## **Multi-Collateral Dai &lt;-&gt; xDai Bridge**

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q4 2019  
âœ…**Status**: Complete. Summary: [https://forum.poa.network/t/migration-of-the-xdai-tokenbridge-completed/3212](https://forum.poa.network/t/migration-of-the-xdai-tokenbridge-completed/3212)

{% hint style="success" %}
xDai bridge is upgraded to support both Dai and Sai.

Bridge balance migrated from Sai to Dai. Both Dai and Sai can be deposited on the Ethereum side. Sai to Dai converted automatically.

_Update 4/15/2020: With the impending Sai shutdown, Sai transfers are no longer allowed on the bridge._ [_https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020394612-How-to-connect-a-Trezor-or-Ledger-Hardware-Wallet_](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020394612-How-to-connect-a-Trezor-or-Ledger-Hardware-Wallet)\_\_
{% endhint %}

## Chai &lt;-&gt; Dai Bridge Contracts Update

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q1 2020  
âœ…**Status**: Completed 03/31/2020

{% hint style="success" %}
Bridge contracts are upgraded and functional. For more on _**`CHAI,`**_ see the [Chai FAQs](../for-stakers/stake-reward-mechanics/xdai-rewards/chai-faqs.md).
{% endhint %}

The new version of the bridge contract supports usage of [the Dai Savings Rate contract](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/dsr) through [the Chai token](https://chai.money/) to earn the interest for tokens deposited on the bridge balance. Dai locked in the bridge contract is converted to Chai, an interest earning form of Dai. The interest accumulated from the locked Chai during a staking epoch will be used as an additional incentive for stakers **in Phase 2** of the consensus upgrade. 

## Consensus POSDAO Upgrade: Phase 1

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q1-Q2 2020  
âœ…**Status**: Completed 04/01/2020

{% hint style="success" %}
Phase 1 of the POSDAO upgrade was successfully activated April 1, 2020. 
{% endhint %}

xDai will upgrade to a Proof of Stake model in several phases. In the first phase, the current validators will receive xDai-based STAKE tokens and to protect the chain. These validators will remain in place to assist in the transition to phase 2.

For more information on this transition, see the [staking roadmap](../for-stakers/stake-and-staking/).

## EasyStaking STAKE on Ethereum

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q3 2020  
âœ… **Status**: Completed 08/05/2020

[Easy Staking](../for-stakers/easy-staking/) provides an alternative interest-earning application for [STAKE ](../for-stakers/stake-token/)token holders. Users can deposit STAKE tokens deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and earn a pre-determined interest rate without bridging to xDai and with no minimum STAKE amount requirements. Rewards are split among Liquidity Providers and protocol stakers.

Easy Staking serves to reduce the overall amount of STAKE in active circulation and acts as a mechanism to limit available liquidity and supply. Limited supply in the open market increases security for POSDAO chains such as the xDai stable chain.

## EasyStaking Liquidity Pool Analytics

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q3 2020  
â˜‘ **Status:** In process

EasyStaking rewards Liquidity Pool \(LP\) participants as well as stakers in the EasyStaking protocol. [Rewards fluctuate based on numerous factors](../for-stakers/easy-staking/#liquidity-pool-lp-participants), and additional analytics and dashboards for LPs will be useful for determining staking strategies, reviewing historical outcomes and viewing current statistics. 

We will integrate statistics views on the EasyStaking platform as well as develop additional analytics tools \(currently exploring options like Dune Analytics & Graphana\) for LPs.

## Multi-Token Bridge

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q3 2020  
â˜‘ **Status:** In process

Universal mediators will support transfers for virtually any ERC20 token to the xDai chain with no additional contract deployment. This will lower the barrier-to-entry for projects and DApps looking to move tokens to xDai and take advantage of low-fee, high-speed transactions.

Users will have the ability to send a token to a contract address \(or contract ENS name such as xdaibridge.eth\) and an ERC677 token equivalent will be automatically created and deployed to xDai, ready for immediate use.   

## Consensus POSDAO Upgrade: Phase **2**

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q4 2020  
â˜‘ **Status:** In process. UI development and protocol enhancements ongoing, see the [staking roadmap](../for-stakers/stake-and-staking/) for more information.

To increase decentralization and enable a permissionless consensus process,  the broader community will have the opportunity to participate as validators and/or delegators in the consensus process. 

## **Privacy Preserving Transactions**

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q3-Q4 2020  
â˜‘ **Status:** In process, defining requirements and exploring approaches

Implementation of additional zero-knowledge protocols and private transactions into xDai.

Since xDai is a stable token, the primary use of the chain is peer-to-peer payments. Just as with cash, privacy and anonymity should be an option when exchanging money or paying vendors for services. 

Currently, [Tornado.cash](https://tornado.cash/) is available to users to ensure Dai anonymity. Dai can be used with tornado.cash before and after bridging to xDai to ensure transaction anonymity.

We also plan to implement privacy preserving transactions on xDai directly. Additionally, we plan to enable privacy for STAKE transactions, allowing for anonymous staking on xDai and Ethereum.

We have invested in several [different approaches ](https://forum.poa.network/t/introducing-the-poa-zero-knowledge-fund/2698)to implement different ZK protocols into xDai based applications and wallets.

## Synthetic Assets on xDai based on UMA protocol

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q2 2020  
â˜‘ **Status:** In process. 50% implementation

UMA is a decentralized financial contracts platform built to enable Universal Market Access. Use UMAâ€™s self-enforcing contract design patterns and provably honest oracle mechanism to create your own financial products using standards like ERC20

xDai will leverage UMA protocol to create derivatives on fiat currencies and enable them in supporting wallets. We currently have a reference implementation where sUSD can be transferred from the Ethereum Mainnet to the xDai chain and back. [sUSD example](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/susd-bridge-extension/transfer-susd-through-the-bridge-extension).

## L2 scalability for token transfers on xDai

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q1 2021

We will research adopting other platforms such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Eth2 and [optimistic rollups](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/) deployed to xDai to implement a scalability solution on xDai. This will enable scaling of transfers \(up to 1000x\) for native tokens and synthetic tokens on top of xDai. 

## POSDAO Phase 3

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q2 2021

A chain created specifically to leverage [POSDAO](../for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md), HoneyBadger BFT and Multi-Collateral DAI. This network will be designed from the ground up with our collaborative partners [LUKSO](https://www.lukso.network/) and [ARTIS](https://artis.eco/) to leverage [STAKE ](../for-stakers/stake-token/)tokens and HBBFT consensus.
