# Governance

Community members can create and vote on proposals related to changes, improvements or anything they would like to see with the xDai ecosystem. 

**Standard order of events for community governance:**

{% hint style="info" %}
Please see the [stake-weighted voting](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x42F38ec5A75acCEc50054671233dfAC9C0E7A3F6/settings) section for more information on creating and voting. Currently you need STAKE on Ethereum to vote, this includes STAKE that is currently locked in Easy Staking.
{% endhint %}

1. [Create a proposal on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/xdaistake.eth). This can be a simple proposal to assess community sentiment. If you have more details, you can post in addition to a forum post in step 2, or wait until the community vote to add to step 2. Leave enough time so that you can let the community know to vote on your proposal \(step 3\). 
2. [Forum post in proposals section of xDai forum](https://forum.poa.network/c/xdai-chain/xdai-proposals/43). Here you can add more information about your proposal, either before, during or after the snapshot vote. 
3. Let the community know about your proposal by posting it in [telegram](https://t.me/xdaistable) and/or [discord](https://discord.gg/mPJ9zkq). 
4. Depending on the nature and type of proposal the team will take the information into consideration and post questions/comments on your forum post. 
   1. If proposal is specifically related to bridge issues, you can also engage members of the Bridge Governance Board by notifying them about your post.
      1. [Learn More About the Board](../about-xdai/faqs/bridges-xdai-bridge-and-omnibridge.md#what-is-the-bridge-governance-board)

{% hint style="info" %}
Proposals act as signaling events, but are never automatically enacted. Even if a proposal is popular in the community, snapshot/forum posts are suggestions and depending on technical requirements or other issues may not be enacted by the xDai technical team or bridge governors.
