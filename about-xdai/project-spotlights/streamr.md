## What are Streamr Data Unions?

Data unions enable sharing and consumption of decentralized data by connecting data providers and data buyers. Data Unions are published on the Streamr [Marketplace](https://streamr.network/marketplace), then run on xDai for scalability and cost efficiency. For more on Data Unions and how they work, see the [Streamr Docs](https://streamr.network/docs/data-unions/intro-to-data-unions). 

## xDai integration

With Data Unions 2.0, contracts are completely on-chain, resulting in greater security and decentralization. Data Union members now have a choice to withdraw earned DATA tokens on xDai and avoid high withdrawal costs. These tokens can then be used, traded and transferred within the xDai ecosystem, for example on [HoneySwap](https://honeyswap.org/) or other DEXs and DeFi protocols without high Ethereum fees.  Tokens can remain within the xDai ecosytem, or bridged to Ethereum or other chains \(ie Binance Smart Chain\) as desired.

The Omnibridge enables interoperability between xDai and Ethereum, and is used by the Streamr team to pass data calls and facilitate token transfers between contracts on both chains.

### Benefits for xDai

Streamr Data Unions framework immediately brings a large group users to the xDai chain, including Swash users \(14K+ users\). Swash is the first Data Union which monetizes browsing data. xDai will enable inexpensive withdrawals and trading options for DATA token holders on xDai.

Future data streams may include health data, smart city data and many other types of streams. 

### Benefits for Streamr

Streamr outlines a number of reasons why they selected xDai as their scalability solution to start.

* Stable, predictable fees.
* Low transaction fees makes withdrawals feasible for large unions with 1000s of members.
* OmniBridge supports asset and cross-chain data transfers.
* Team synergy!
