# Getting xDai tokens

Ways to acquire xDai stable tokens:

* From another user on the xDai Chain
* Converting Dai to xDai using the [xDai Bridge](converting-xdai-via-bridge/)
* Purchase directly with fiat using [Ramp.Network](https://ramp.network/buy/?swapAsset=XDAI)

{% hint style="info" %}
xDai direct purchases \(Carbon or Wyre\) are currently under construction.  Purchase Dai on the mainnet and use the bridge to get xDai, or for an all-in-one exchange process you can use the[ Burner Wallet Exchange](burner-wallet-functions/exchange-currencies.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The xDai ecosystem supports 2 tokens, the xDAI stable token and the STAKE governance token. [Learn More about STAKE](../about-xdai/faqs/stake-staking-token.md).
