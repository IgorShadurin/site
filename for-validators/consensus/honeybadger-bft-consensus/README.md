# HoneyBadger BFT Consensus

The xDai team is currently working on a working implementation of [HoneyBadger BFT ](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/199)consensus. This **may be** implemented on the xDai chain \(determined through the governance process\) and explored in [Phase 3 of the POSDAO staking roadmap](../../../for-stakers/stake-and-staking/#phase-3-honeybadger-bft-consensus-layer-integration).

{% hint style="success" %}
_Our Honey Badger BFT and Threshold Cryptography implementations have both undergone extensive security audits to ensure safety and cryptographic integrity. The results are available here_

* [_HBBFT Security Audit_](https://github.com/poanetwork/wiki/blob/3a155878cd2c58e6a870a2c127ef302037e1b15f/assets/pdf/hbbft-audit-report.pdf)
* [_Threshold\_Cryto Security Audit_ ](https://github.com/poanetwork/wiki/wiki/Threshold-Crypto-Audit)

The Honey Badger consensus algorithm allows nodes in a distributed, potentially asynchronous environment to achieve agreement on transactions. The agreement process does not require a leader node, tolerates corrupted nodes, and makes progress in adverse network conditions.

Honey Badger is **Byzantine Fault Tolerant**. The protocol can reach consensus with a number of failed nodes f \(including complete takeover by an attacker\), as long as the total number N of nodes is greater than 3 \* f.

Honey Badger is **asynchronous**. It does not make timing assumptions about message delivery. An adversary can control network scheduling and delay messages without impacting consensus.
