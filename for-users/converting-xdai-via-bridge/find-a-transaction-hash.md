# Find a Transaction Hash

When completing a transfer from the xDai chain to Ethereum \(converting xDai to Dai\), you will submit the transaction hash containing validator confirmation of the event to the Ethereum Network. This transaction is created on the xDai chain and then copied and claimed on Ethereum. 

## Using the Bridge UI with MetaMask:

{% hint style="info" %}
In this example we use the Sokol testnet.

* xDai = Sokol
* Ethereum = Kovan
{% endhint %}

1\) Go to MetaMask and click on the Contract Interaction TX in the activity tab of your account.
