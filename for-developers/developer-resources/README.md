ðŸš€ QuikNode also supports xDai. Devs can get their own custom endpoint for DApps or other needs. [https://blog.quiknode.io/xdai-network-is-live-on-quiknode/](https://blog.quiknode.io/xdai-network-is-live-on-quiknode/)

## TokenBridge

A bridge is required to move locked Dai from Ethereum and mint xDai on xDai Chain

You can access the bridge via:

* TokenBridge UI at [https://dai-bridge.poa.network](https://dai-bridge.poa.network)
* Interactions with Smart contracts[ ](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/xdai-bridge/how-to-use-xdai-bridge-without-ui)[https://docs.tokenbridge.net/xdai-bridge/how-to-use-xdai-bridge-without-ui](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/xdai-bridge/how-to-use-xdai-bridge-without-ui)
* Bridge UI built-in into AlphaWallet, BurnerWallet, BurnerFactory

## DApp Management & Developer Tools

* [Biconomy](https://medium.com/biconomy/biconomy-supports-xdai-chain-4d21d1f70222) allows for for gasless transactions and improved DApp UX.
* [Pocket](https://www.pokt.network/) provides a decentralized API layer for DApp developers \(IOS, Android & Web SDKs available\) and blockchain users.
* [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com) supports xDai data indexing, querying and display.
* [Chainbeat](https://chainbeat.io/) provides monitoring and analytics tools for DApp developers.
* [BlockNative](https://docs.blocknative.com/) supports real-time notification monitoring with API and SDK tools.
* [Token faucet](https://erc20faucet.com/) allows you to easily create ERC20 FAU tokens for testing purposes
* [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) dashboard supports xDai transaction inspection - smart contracts can also be pushed to the dashboard for real-time monitoring.
* [QuikNode](https://www.quiknode.io/) gives users a super-fast Web3 endpoint for accessing or interacting with the xDai chain.
* [CurveGrid](https://www.curvegrid.com/) provides smart contract deployment, interaction and updating capabilities  through a web UI as well as a comprehensive REST API.
* [3Box](https://www.3box.io/):  Externally Owned Account \(EOA\) addresses are the same on xDai as they are on other EVM networks, so no changes are needed to implement 3box functionality.
