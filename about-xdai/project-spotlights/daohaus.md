# DAOHaus

DAO \(Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\) are thriving on the blockchain. Unfortunately, high gas prices have created a situation where governance is very expensive. Proposal creation and voting is what allows DAOs to make decisions, choose directions and create rules for their organizations in a decentralized way. To alleviate these cost concerns, DAOHaus has created an instance on the xDai chain!

‚öî You will also need some xDai - you can convert Dai to xDai using the bridge UI at [https://dai-bridge.poa.network/](https://dai-bridge.poa.network/).  Connect your web3 wallet to Ethereum and select the amount of Dai to transfer. Once it is transferred, connect to the xDai network to interact with Daohaus.

**Daohaus** strives to be the most forward-thinking, user-friendly dao experience. In Daohaus, you can discover and join existing daos, as well as launch your own. Launching a dao on Daohaus provides a landing page where others can pledge to join. With our latest release, daos also get a Pokemol \(mobile-friendly app for dao proposal interaction\) interface automatically.
