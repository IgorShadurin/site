# ZK \(Zero Knowledge\) Privacy Fund

{% hint style="success" %}
Grant Program will reopen in Q4 2020. Stay tuned for details.
{% endhint %}

A grant to fund ZK applications on xDai and other Layer 2 sidechains. ZK proofs offer the ability for users to make private transactions.

Why implement on xDai? Since xDai is a stable token, a primary use of the chain is peer-to-peer payments. Just as with cash, privacy should be an option when exchanging money or paying vendors for services. ZK protocols allow users to use xDai freely and anonymously.

**To date, we have already distributed:** 

* 30k Dai to Austin Griffith to implement ZK transactions in Burner Wallet
* 10k Dai to Poketto team to implement ZK transactions in Poketto Cash wallet
* 1.55mm POA \(~22k Dai\) to Tornado Cash team to deploy Tornado on xDai Chain
