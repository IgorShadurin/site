# dark forest

[Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) is an MMO space-conquest game where players discover and conquer planets in an infinite, procedurally-generated, cryptographically-specified universe!

Using [zkSNARKS](https://blog.zkga.me/intro-to-zksnarks), dark forest is able to create an incomplete information game, so that user locations can be obscured while still submitting verifiable transactions.

Dark Forest was inspired by Liu Cixinâ€™s _Three Body Trilogy_ \(ä¸‰ä½“\), particularly the second novel _Dark Forest_ and a thought experiment by the same name.

The latest version \(v0.4\) uses a burner wallet and is in production on xDai. This allows for a higher TPS as well as real economic value loaded onto the game. In addition, users are airdropped a small amount of xDai so they can begin gameplay immediately, without any external wallet or need to get xDai to start. Once users are accustomed to gameplay they can add additional xDai if desired.

Simply go to [https://zkga.me/](https://zkga.me/) to start \(note that the game is in Beta and you will need a whitelist key to participate\). At the start, a few command line prompts will get things going, and you can create a new burner wallet or use another wallet \(one without too much value, as private keys will be stored in local storage\)

Once you "check in" with the CLI, the universe begins to populate and you see your home planet......
