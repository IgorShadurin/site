# xDai Faucet

{% hint style="success" %}
Faucet is now live with SMS phone verification through Twilio\* and multiple hCaptcha prompts to prevent abuse.
{% endhint %}

A small amount of xDai is needed to use the chain and process transactions. Thousands of simple transactions can be completed with $0.10 xDai, and it doesn't make sense to bridge this amount. The [xDai Faucet on Blockscout](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet) sends $0.10 xDai to your account with ease! It can be used once every 24 hours.

_\*Raw phone numbers are not stored in the database, only used to prevent faucet abuse._

1\) Go to [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet)

2. Enter a valid phone number where you can receive a SMS text message. Be sure to select the correct country with the flag icon.

You will see a success message. Check your balance on the xDai chain to see that that you received funds from the faucet \(See [getting started with xDai](../getting-started-with-xdai.md) if you have questions around connecting to the xDai chain\).

3\) It is also possible to donate to the faucet and help your community! Click the **Donate button** and complete the transaction in MetaMask to add xDai to the faucet. Donations are automatically set to 10 xDai.
