# Crypto stamp

{% hint style="info" %}
The official launch of the Crypto stamp 3.0 is 21 June 2021. It will be available online and onchain at [crypto.post.at](https://crypto.post.at/), in post office branches, philately shops and sales points, as well as via the Collectorsâ€™ Service.

[Crypto stamp](https://crypto.post.at/) is an innovative public project from the [Austrian Post](https://www.post.at/). The program mints digital postage stamps on the blockchain. These digital stamps are also paired with a physical postage stamp. The stamps are legal postage denominated by the Austrian postal service as a way to highlight new technologies, engage collectors, create transparency, and guarantee authenticity.

The first 2 editions were minted directly on Ethereum. For the 3rd edition, the Austrian Post selected the xDai chain for minting. This saves a large amount of fees and energy resources in the minting process while providing stable transaction costs and interoperability options with Ethereum. In addition to being minted on xDai, the latest Crypto stamp 3 has an NFC chip built in which can be used to verify its authenticity. 

**More details on this exciting project coming soon!**
