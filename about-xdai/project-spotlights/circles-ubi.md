# Circles UBI

Circles is a basic income made to promote local economies. CRC tokens are minted daily on the xDai chain for members who can use and trade them within their communities.

Once you create an account you will need 3 people who are already participating in Circles to verify it. This can be a challenge, but as the platform grows it will become easier. It does make sense to ask people you know to verify you, and there are more methods and tips on the Circles Telegram Channel at [https://t.me/CirclesUBI](https://t.me/CirclesUBI)

## Get Started

1\) Go to [https://circles.garden/](https://circles.garden/) and click on Sign up. If you already have an account, click login to enter your 24 word seed phrase.
