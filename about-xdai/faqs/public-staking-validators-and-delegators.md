# Public Staking \(Validators & Delegators\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Public Staking is not yet available on xDai. The chain currently runs on a Proof of Stake consensus called POSDAO with nominated validators. The transition to public validators is scheduled to start in Q4 2020 - Q1 202.
{% endhint %}

## What is a validator?

A validator runs a node that verifies transactions and finalizes blocks on the xDai chain. Each validator must provide the minimum STAKE collateral \(20K STAKE\) into their pool and setup a functional node to participate. They start as candidates, and have the chance to become validators each week when a new validator set is chosen.

## What is the maximum number of validators?

The max number of validators in a validator set is 19. This is called a validator set and is chosen each week from the group of validator candidates. 

## What is the maximum number of validator candidates?

The maximum number of candidates is 3000.

## How are validators selected?

If there are more than 19 suitable candidates, the top 19 are chosen based on the total amount of stake in their pool + a random number.

## What is a delegator?

A delegator is a STAKE holder who places STAKE in a validator candidates pool. If that candidate becomes a validator, the delegator also receives rewards. By placing STAKE, delegators vote on the candidates they think will make the best validators. 1K minimum delegation per validator candidate.

## How long is a staking epoch?

A staking epoch is 1 week. 

## How does a participant \(validator, candidate or delegator\) add/withdraw/claim STAKE?

A UI is in process that will allow delegators and validators to easily manage their STAKE tokens. For more info, see the [Staking Operations](../../for-stakers/staking-protocol/staking-operations/) section.

## How do I get STAKE rewards as a validator/delegator?

Rewards are automatically distributed at the end of a staking epoch to active validators and delegators.

## What rewards can I expect as a participant?

See the [rewards in a dual token environment post](../../for-stakers/stake-reward-mechanics/rewards-in-a-dual-token-environment.md) for more information. As a validator, you will always receive at least 30% of your pool's rewards, and more if delegators contribute less than 70% to the pool. Rewards are based on how much STAKE is staked in the protocol as well as chain-based activity \(stable rewards come from bridge fees and transactions, as well as Chai based rewards from DAI locked in the bridge\). Staking rewards will accumulate at 15% APR based on the locked amount.
