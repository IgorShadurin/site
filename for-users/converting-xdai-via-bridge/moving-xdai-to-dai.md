# Moving xDai to Dai

1\) Go to [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/). [Connect your web3 wallet](../wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) \(MetaMask, Nifty Wallet\) to the **xDai Chain**. Once connected, you will see your address populated in the header, and your xDai and Dai balance displayed on the page. 

{% hint style="success" %}
If you are experiencing issues or for personal preference, you can go to [https://xdai.io/](https://xdai.io/) and exchange using the burner application.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a very small additional amount of xDai to process the transaction.
{% endhint %}

_Note: If you change the dropdown on the page \(xDai Chain\) but not in MetaMask, the interface will shift but your wallet will not auto-connect to the chain. Switching chains in MM will automatically shift the interface._

2\) Enter the amount of xDai you would like to transfer to Dai, and click the **Transfer** button. Note the **minimum amount is 10 xDai.**

3\) A confirmation window will appear. Click **Continue.**

4\) The web3 wallet window will open with transaction details. Click **Submit or Confirm** \(depending on wallet\) to process the transaction.

5\) Wait for the transaction to process. The relay confirmation can take additional time \(depending on the number of chain validators and the mainnet network throughput\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
If your transaction is taking longer than 10 minutes and you want to pay an additional fee to speed it up, [see these instructions](troubleshooting.md#xdai-to-dai). Otherwise, you can wait and it will process eventually.
{% endhint %}

6\) Success! xDai has been transferred to Dai and is available for use on the Ethereum mainnet.
