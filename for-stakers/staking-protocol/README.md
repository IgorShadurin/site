1. Tokens: You will need [STAKE tokens ](../stake-token/)on xDai for staking and xDai for any staking transactions \(such as placing, moving or withdrawing stake\) or other on-chain transactions. Use the [OmniBridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/) to move STAKE from Ethereum to xDai. [Instructions for Omnibridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/multi-token-extension/ui-to-transfer-tokens/transfer-erc20).

3. [Become a Candidate](become-a-candidate-validator.md)**:** Configure an xDai node and place the minimum required stake to become a candidate.
